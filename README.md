Assignment 2 - Music Playlist

Data Structures Implemented (and reasons for picking a certain one):
- Simple LinkedList - Playlist class (creates a simple playlist and allows to insert items in an order)
- Queue - QueuePlaylist class (useful for creating a queue playlist so the first song added is the first song listened to)
- Stack - StackListeningHistory class (provide easy access to the last item added to the stack (last song listened to)
